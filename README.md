# Drozone
Drozone was my first real development project. It uses the Java Swing library to render a 2D sidescrolling game. I made this when I was around 10 or 11, and I worked on it up until 2013. I keep the code on here for sentimental purposes, to look back and remember the first few years that I started coding.
